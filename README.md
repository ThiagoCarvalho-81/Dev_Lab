# Dev_Lab
This is a development repository of an eternal student.

One that believes that: 
* Every day we must learn something new. 
* New knowledge shouldn't decrease humbleness.
* Collaboration is the key to learning and to giving back all the collaboration received.

The goal of this repository is to store and record this journey from an experienced (continually improving) business expert to becoming a data scientist.
